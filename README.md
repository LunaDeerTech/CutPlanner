# CutPlanner

A cutting optimization and planning application designed to help users efficiently plan cuts for materials such as wood, metal, fabric, or other sheet goods. The application aims to minimize waste and optimize material usage through intelligent cutting algorithms.

## Features

- **Optimal Cutting Plans**: Generate efficient cutting layouts that minimize material waste
- **Multi-Material Support**: Work with various materials including wood, metal, fabric, and sheet goods
- **Cutting Algorithms**: Multiple optimization strategies for different use cases
- **Visual Layouts**: Clear visualizations of cutting plans and layouts
- **Export Options**: Support for various file formats and CNC machine integration

## Development

This project includes GitHub Copilot instructions to help developers understand the domain-specific requirements and coding conventions. See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed guidelines on:

- Project structure and conventions
- Domain-specific terminology and algorithms
- Testing strategies for cutting optimization
- Performance considerations
- UI/UX guidelines for manufacturing interfaces

## Getting Started

*Project setup instructions will be added as the application is developed.*
